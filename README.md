# Hatchery Management Calculator

A simple static web app for hatchery calculations (rotifer feed, artemia cysts, stocking, chemical dosing, liming).

How to run locally:
1. Save `index.html` in a folder.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (no build step required).

Deploy to GitHub Pages:
- Create a repository (e.g. `lqpcbaru/hatchery-calculator`), push `index.html` to the root of the `main` branch.
- In the repo Settings -> Pages, set Source to `main` branch and root folder.
- GitHub Pages will publish the site at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/` (or at `https://<username>.github.io/` if repo named `<username>.github.io`).

If you want, I can:
- Push these files to a new repo under your account (lqpcbaru). Confirm repo name and visibility and whether to enable Pages.
- Alternatively set up a GitHub Action to deploy to `gh-pages` branch automatically.

License: (optional) Choose a license and I will add it.
